# RacingApp2
In order to learn asynchronous programming, students were tasked with creating a console app simulating a race between several cars.
Each car was to run the race in separate threads in order to mimic reality.

## General info:
* Distance: 10km
* Car speed: 120km/h
* The simulation time is speed up 10x.
* Every 30 seconds a random event may occur: Run out of fuel, punctured tire, bird on windshield, engine failure.
* A status update for all cars is generated by pressing enter.
